Task 1: Identifying Key Operations

The provided algorithm is a classic example of Bubble Sort. Let's break down the key operations it performs:
Outer Loop: The outer loop runs n times, where n is the length of the array. This loop ensures that each element is compared and swapped if necessary 
.
Inner Loop: The inner loop runs n-i-1 times for each iteration of the outer loop. This loop performs the actual comparison and swapping of adjacent elements 
.
Comparison and Swap: Within the inner loop, each pair of adjacent elements is compared, and if they are in the wrong order, they are swapped 
.
These operations are fundamental to the Bubble Sort algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order 
.
Task 2: Calculating Big O Complexity

To express how the algorithm's runtime grows concerning the size of the input, we apply the principles of Big O notation:
Outer Loop Complexity: The outer loop runs n times 
.
Inner Loop Complexity: The inner loop runs n-i-1 times for each iteration of the outer loop. On average, this results in approximately n/2 iterations per outer loop iteration 
.
Total Comparisons and Swaps: The total number of comparisons and swaps is the sum of the series n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1, which simplifies to n(n-1)/2 
.
Thus, the time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm is O(nÂ²), as the number of operations grows quadratically with the input size 
.
Task 3: Efficiency Analysis

Efficiency Aspects

Bubble Sort is known for its simplicity but is inefficient for large datasets due to its O(nÂ²) time complexity. This quadratic growth means that as the input size increases, the runtime increases dramatically, making it impractical for large datasets 
.
Potential Improvements

Early Termination: Implementing a flag to check if any swaps were made during an iteration can help terminate the algorithm early if the array becomes sorted before completing all iterations 
.
Optimized Bubble Sort: By reducing the range of the inner loop after each pass, we can avoid unnecessary comparisons for elements that are already sorted 
.
Alternative Algorithms

Merge Sort: This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is more efficient for larger datasets. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to split the array into smaller subarrays, sort them, and then merge them back together 
.
Quick Sort: With an average time complexity of O(n log n), Quick Sort is another efficient sorting algorithm that works well for large datasets. It selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot 
.
Heap Sort: This algorithm also has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is efficient for large datasets. It builds a heap from the input data and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element to build the sorted array 
.

.
By understanding the Big O complexity and efficiency of the Bubble Sort algorithm, we can make informed decisions about when to use it and when to opt for more efficient sorting algorithms.
